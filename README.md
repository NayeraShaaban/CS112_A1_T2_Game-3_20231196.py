This Python code implements a simple two-player game where players take turns subtracting perfect square numbers from an initial number of coins until no coins are left.
This code starts by prompting the user to input the initial number of coins. It then checks if the input is a perfect square; if so, it prompts the user again until a non-perfect square number is provided.
The game continues with Player 1 and Player 2 taking turns choosing valid moves (perfect square numbers) until no coins are left.
After each move, the code checks if the chosen move is valid and updates the number of remaining coins accordingly.
The game loop terminates when one player successfully reduces the number of coins to zero, and the winner is announced.
